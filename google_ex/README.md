## Google Coding Interview Questions

### **_Daily Coding Problem_**
### **_Problem #1[Easy]:_**

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today. This problem was recently asked by Google. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

**For example:**  Given array = [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

### **_Daily Coding Problem_**
### **_Problem #18[Hard]:_**

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.This problem was asked by Google.Given an array of integers and a number k,
where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

**For example:** given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:
```
   10 = max(10, 5, 2)
   7  = max(5, 2, 7)
   8  = max(2, 7, 8)
   8  = max(7, 8, 7)
```   
Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply
print them out as you compute them.
